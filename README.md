# qr_scanner

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I am using qr_code_scanner_plus package didnt used the mentioned one becasue it was outdated and will not 
work in flutter 3.24 and above

I have also use permission_handler: ^11.3.1 package to check camera permission 

Any one can scan the camera and see the result in the console
